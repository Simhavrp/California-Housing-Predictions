# California-Housing-Predictions
This project focuses on predicting median house values in California using the California Housing dataset. The process involves loading and preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and relationships, and building regression models to make predictions. Simple and multiple linear regression models are employed, alongside a more advanced Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR) model. The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to compare their performance, with visualization techniques employed to assess the accuracy of predictions.
